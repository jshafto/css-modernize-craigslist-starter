# Modernize Craigslist CSS Project
This project was completed as part of the App Academy curriculum. Implementation by Juliet Shafto and .


## Project Description
Craigslist is a notoriously under-designed and also very successful website. Its table-like design, gray panels, and royal blue hyperlinks hearken back to the early days of the Internet. It might be a blast from the past, but with a few simple style tweaks we can bring Craigslist into the modern world.

The objective of this project is to re-skin the Craigslist homepage to use a more modern design aesthetic.
